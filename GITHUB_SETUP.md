# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since the repository https://github.com/rajesh1084/biometric-attendance-report.git doesn't exist yet, you'll need to create it first on GitHub.

## Steps to create the repository on GitHub:

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account (rajesh1084)

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `biometric-attendance-report`
   - Description: `Python Pandas program that generates PDF attendance reports with late and early punch analysis`
   - Make it Public (or Private as per your preference)
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push the existing code:**
   Once the repository is created on GitHub, run these commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/rajesh/Desktop/test2
   git remote add origin https://github.com/rajesh1084/biometric-attendance-report.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Create with different repository name

If you want to use a different repository name, you can:

1. Create a repository with any name (e.g., `attendance-report-generator`)
2. Update the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rajesh1084/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Repository is ready for GitHub!

Your local repository is already set up with:
- ✅ All source code committed
- ✅ Proper .gitignore file
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Requirements.txt
- ✅ Test script

Once you create the repository on GitHub and push the code, it will be available at:
https://github.com/rajesh1084/biometric-attendance-report
